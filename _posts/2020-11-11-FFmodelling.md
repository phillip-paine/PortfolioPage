 Introduction to Fantasy Football
--------------------------------

The English Premier League Fantasy Football is a game played alongside
the English Premier League (EPL) that allows fans to create a team of
Premier League footballers, under a number of constraints, and compete
against other people‚Äôs teams. As EPL matches are played footballers are
awarded points based on their individual and club performance, this in
turn impacts their transfer value within the game. Each player builds a
team with 100 million pounds so that anyone cannot just buy the 11 best
footballers in the EPL, in addition no more than three players from the
same club can be on the team. Each player‚Äôs aim is to create the best
possible team within the budget and the three players from a club rule.
Each week every player can make one transfer for free, selling one
footballer and buying another to replace them staying within budget, and
can make additional transfers at the cost of two points.

Players make transfers using statistics from the Fantasy Football
website, personal evaluations of a footballer‚Äôs current form and
educated guesses of future match results. In this notebook we use
statistical models to attempt to find the best possible transfer each
week by predicting the points every player will accrue in the next
gameweek matches. In the EPL Fantasy Football players select not just a
starting 11 but also 4 substitutes, in this work we ignore substitutions
and concentrate on the starting team only.

In Figure 1 an example fantasy football team is shown. The table shows
the data at the end of the first three rounds for just three players,
Harry Kane, Jonny Evans and Mo Salah.

The available data each week consists of statistics for individual
player performance e.g.¬†goals, assists, minutes played, transfer value,
and fantasy football statistics e.g.¬†fantasy points, ‚Äòcreativity‚Äô,
‚Äòinfluence‚Äô etc. In addition, we also have the match results themselves
and future fixture information.

Figure 2 previews a selection of columns for a handful of players in the
match data.

Like most events in 2020 the EPL was affected by Covid-19 and many
matches were postponed. After a few months break the EPL returned
without crowds and whilst there are many interesting questions posed by
such an extended mid-season break and the absence of crowds, in this
analysis we ignore any matches played after covid-19 impacted the EPL.
Covid-19 first caused games to be postponed in Gameweek 28, therefore we
model matches up to Gameweek 26 and the final week of predictions is
Gameweek 27. In addition to Covid-19, Liverpool‚Äôs participation in the
Club World Cup resulted in their match against West Ham United being
postponed from Gameweek 18 to Gameweek 24 - we use the postponed fixture
only for modelling team strength and do not count that game towards
fantasy football points.

Exploration of the Data
-----------------------

The data used in this work is taken from the github page:
<a href="https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League/tree/master/data/2019-20" class="uri">https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League/tree/master/data/2019-20</a>
.

The first interesting question one must answer in EPL Fantasy Football
is which formation to play, this leads to attempting to find the best
value position. From the data, the most efficient position (in the sense
of points per pound spent) is goalkeeper and the least efficient is
midfield. This does not mean we shouldn‚Äôt favour midfielders because as
long as the team is within the budget, the cost per point is not the
most important factor. In the modelling stage we will allow any
transfers that give valid formations.

<img src="https://github.com/phillip-paine/FantasyFootball1920/blob/main/Club_Position_AvgCostPerPoint.png?raw=true" alt="Figure 3: The cost per point scored for each player aggregated within each club and position." width="70%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 3: The cost per point scored for each player aggregated within
each club and position.
</p>

Looking at Figure 3 we can see that there is considerable variance
between clubs, however we see that some clubs tend to have undervalued
players and some have overvalued players. This is likely a consequence
of under/over-rating certain teams and of popular footballers.

<img src="https://github.com/phillip-paine/FantasyFootball1920/blob/main/Top_Player_AvgCost_TotalPoints.png?raw=true" alt="Figure 4: Average cost during the season against total points scored during the season, with select players highlighted." width="70%" />

In Figure 4 we look at the average cost per point of individual
footballers and highlight the best-performing players in each position.
It is interesting to note that there appears to be footballers that are
very cost-effective in a points per pound perspective and also
footballers that seem to be greatly overvalued compared to the points
scored. For example, if we look along the y-axis at 125 points scored
there is a large variation of prices for midfielders and forwards.

<img src="https://github.com/phillip-paine/FantasyFootball1920/blob/main/PlayesMatchData_CorrelationPlot.png?raw=true" alt="Figure 5: Spearman correlation plot." width="80%" />

In Figure 5 the Spearman correlation plot shows the correlation between
the match statistic data and the weekly points (‚Äòtotal points‚Äô), this
gives an idea of the features we may want to include in the model to
predict the weekly points for each footballer in the EPL. Note that
although real-world match performance is important footballers are
awarded fantasy football points based on a set of rules, and don‚Äôt
necessarily reflect the best footballers. As we would expect, total
points is most strongly positively correlated with clean sheets and
goals scored and negatively correlated with goals conceded, suggesting
that goals are an important indicator of points.

Modelling Player Performance in Fantasy Football
------------------------------------------------

As stated in the introduction the aim of this work is to find the best
transfer each week given the current starting 11, the available transfer
budget and the upcoming fixtures. To do this the modelling problem can
be stated as predicting the number of points every footballer in the
league is expected to get in each gameweek. The approach used here is a
two-step process: first, we model the strength of both teams in a match
and then, we model the number of points each player in the match will
score. To model the relative strengths of teams in a match-up we use a
Bayesian hierarchical Poisson model that assigns an attacking and
defensive strength factor estimated using previous results. The weekly
points prediction for each footballer uses a random forest model that
includes the team and opposition coeficients output from the first step.

The algorithm starts modelling data at game week 5, i.e.¬†every team has
five completed fixtures at this stage, and then gameweek 6 is the first
week the model predicts fantasy football points. The algorithm is
outlined below:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Algorithm**: Predicting Footballer Fantasy Football Match Points

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  For loop over gameweek (gw) 5 to 26: each step 2-5 is run in every
    loop
2.  Bayesian Poisson model is fit to the results up to and including
    gameweek gw; outputs the attack and defensive coefficients for each
    team.
3.  Fit a random forest to the player performance statistics up to
    gameweek gw where weekly points is the dependent variable, and
    predict the points for each player in (gw + 1).
4.  Use the predicted fantasy football points to find the best transfer
    (within budget and player-per-team constraints).
5.  Return to step 1 unless gw = 26

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a number of complications that are not mentioned above,
e.g.¬†creating variables for the random forest, and no Liverpool or West
Ham United players in game week 18.

Modelling Team Attack and Defense Coefficient: Bayesian Poisson Model in JAGS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To model the score of a fixture, we model the expected number of goals
each team scores using the Poisson distribution. The parameter in the
Poisson distribution for the number of goals a team scores takes into
account if a team was home or away, the attacking coefficient of that
team, and the defensive coefficient of the opposition. The parameters in
the model are estimated using all completed fixtures. The model for the
expected number of goals scored by Team A against Team B is given by:

$$ \\begin{align}
 Y & = \\text{Po} \\left( \\lambda \\right) , \\text{ where} \\\\
 \\log \\left( \\lambda \\right) & = X\_h \\mathbb{1}\_h + \\alpha\_A + \\beta\_B .
\\end{align} $$

The parameter *Œª* is the expected number of goals scored by team A
against team B, *X*<sub>*h*</sub> is a random variable that adjusts the
expected number of goals a team scores in a home game compared to an
away game (it is well-known in football that home advantage confers a
significant increase in the expected number of goals a team scores),
ùüô<sub>*h*</sub> is the indicator of whether a team is home or away,
*Œ±*<sub>*A*</sub> is the attacking coefficient of team A and
*Œ≤*<sub>*B*</sub> is the defensive coefficient of team B.

The parameters in the model have the following prior distributions:
$$ \\begin{align}
 X\_h & \\sim \\mathcal{N} \\left( 0, 0.0001 \\right) \\\\
 \\alpha\_A & \\sim \\mathcal{N} \\left( \\mu\_{\\alpha\_A} , \\tau\_{\\alpha\_A} \\right) \\\\
 \\beta\_B & \\sim \\mathcal{N} \\left( \\mu\_{\\beta\_B} , \\tau\_{\\beta\_B} \\right) .
\\end{align} $$

The hyper-parameters of the attacking and defensive coefficients have
the following prior distributions:
$$ \\begin{align}
 \\mu\_{\\alpha\_A} & \\sim \\mathcal{N} \\left( 0, 0.0001 \\right) \\\\
 \\mu\_{\\beta\_A} & \\sim \\mathcal{N} \\left( 0, 0.0001 \\right) \\\\
 \\tau\_{\\alpha\_A} & \\sim \\Gamma \\left( 0.01, 0.001 \\right) \\\\
 \\tau\_{\\beta\_A} & \\sim \\Gamma \\left( 0.01, 0.001 \\right) .
\\end{align} $$

The normal distributions in all of the above are parameterised by the
mean and the precision; this is same parameterisation used by the JAGS
package.

To fit the Bayesian Poisson model described above we use Just Another
Gibbs Sampling (JAGS); the R package *rjags* is used to connect to the
JAGS library from within R. JAGS uses the BUGS (Bayesian Gibbs Sampling)
language; first, create a bugs model file and then in R use rjags to run
the MCMC algorithm with user-defined parameters, burn-in periods, number
of chains etc.

The Bayesian Poisson model is fit at gameweek 26 to the full fixtures
played up to and including that week. In Table 1 the attacking and
defensive coefficients and the home advantage s given for Liverpool at
home to West Ham United. This can be used to calculate the expected
number of goals that each team scores against the other.

| Team            | Attacking Coefficient | Defensive Coefficient | Home Advantage |
|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| Liverpool       | 0.493                 | -0.39                 | 0.032          |
| West Ham United | -0.096                | 0.157                 | 0              |

Although we only want the attacking and defensive coefficients to model
the predicted fantasy football points for each player, we can use the
Poisson model to calculate the expected number of goals in the fixture
Liverpool vs.¬†West Ham United. Substituting the estimated coefficients
into the model we find the expected number of goals for both teams to be
Liverpool = 1.97 and West Ham United = 0.61.

Predicting Player Fantasy Football Points: Random Forest
--------------------------------------------------------

The random forest model is the piece that actually predicts the number
of points we expect each footballer in a premier league fixture to
score. Random forest models work by fitting a large number of deep
decision trees and then averaging the individual trees. The process
involves at each tree randomly subsampling the observations (rows of the
data) to fit and at each node within each tree randomly subsampling the
features to split on (columns of the data). This tends to achieve good
results compared to other classification or regression techniques.

There are two established methods (that are frequently encountered) for
assessing variable importance, Gini node impurity and random permutation
mean-square error. It is suggested that Gini importance can inflate the
importance of continuous variables or discrete variables with a large
number of categories. Generally, we prefer to use the random permutation
MSE which uses out-of-bag sampling to calculate these values. Here, we
find that both metric find very similar variable importance results.

Gini node impurity measure considers the decrease in Gini impurity at
each split in each tree. The Gini impurity is calculated as the
improvement we see at a node due to splitting on a variable compared to
before the split.

The random permutation MSE variable importance is calculated by randomly
permuting the values in that variable in the out-of-bag sample and
comparing the MSE to the original data (without random permutation of
the values). The idea is that if a variable is important then if we
randomly permute the values in that variable we should find a decrease
in predictive accuracy.

" width="49%" height="20%" />

The variable plots in this case agree with each other to a large extent.
The most important variables are form and value, which is to be
expected, and the next most important are the attacking and defensive
coefficients of both teams.

Evaluating Model Performance: Recent Form Model vs.¬†Jags-Random Forest
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To evaluate the performance of the proposed model we compare the points
predictions against a ‚ÄúNaive Recent Form‚Äù model; the points prediction
for a footballer in the next game is the average of the points in the
previous five matches. The model is considered naive in this setting
because it does not take into account the opponent in either the
previous matches or the upcoming fixture.

The sum of squares error is used to calculate the error between the
model prediction and the observed points accrued by the player. We also
show the performance of each method in selecting the best transfer each
week based on predicted points given the budget and team constraints.

The weekly predicted points scored and actual points scored is
illustrated in the plot below for a selection of players.

<img src="https://github.com/phillip-paine/FantasyFootball1920/blob/main/David_deGea_TotalPoints.png?raw=true" alt="Figure 6: Weekly points scored by David de Gea (left) and Oliver Norwood (right) with the predicted points from both methods." width="49%" height="20%" /><img src="https://github.com/phillip-paine/FantasyFootball1920/blob/main/Oliver_Norwood_TotalPoints.png?raw=true" alt="Figure 6: Weekly points scored by David de Gea (left) and Oliver Norwood (right) with the predicted points from both methods." width="49%" height="20%" />

In Figure 6 we can see that the predicted points match up very well with
the actual points scored by both players, more so in the case of the
random forest-jags approach but it‚Äôs only two players, except when the
player scores very highly. This pattern is seen in the plots of many
players.

Each gameweek the two models predict the points scored by each player in
the upcoming fixtures, the residual sum of squares between the predicted
points scored and the actual points scored for both methods is
calculated.

<img src="https://github.com/phillip-paine/FantasyFootball1920/blob/main/ResidualSS_plot.png?raw=true" alt="Figure 7: Residual sum of squares between actual points scored and the points predicted by both methods" width="80%" />

In Figure 7 We see that consistently the random forest-JAGS method
outperforms the naive recent form model using this measure. In fact, in
every game week that we predict the fantasy football points the random
forest-JAGS model has a lower sum of squares error to the actual points
scored.

<img src="https://github.com/phillip-paine/FantasyFootball1920/blob/main/WeeklyPointsAfterTransfers.png?raw=true" alt="Figure 8: Plots showing for both methods the weekly points scored (left) and the cumulative points scored (right) by the team selected by finding the best transfer each week." width="49%" height="20%" /><img src="https://github.com/phillip-paine/FantasyFootball1920/blob/main/WeeklyPointsAfterTransfers_cumulative.png?raw=true" alt="Figure 8: Plots showing for both methods the weekly points scored (left) and the cumulative points scored (right) by the team selected by finding the best transfer each week." width="49%" height="20%" />

The weekly points scored and cumulative points scored given in Figure 8
assume a starting team of Tim Krul (GK), Virgil van Dijk, C√©sar
Azpilicueta, Jonny Evans (DEF), Mohamed Salah, Kevin De Bruyne, Marc
Albrighton, Andros Townsend, Ayoze P√©rez (MID), Jordan Ayew and
Christian Benteke (FWD) and an assumed bench cost of the remaining
transfer budget at the start of week 1. Each week the models predicts
the expected points scored by each player and the optimal transfer is
made (allowing valid changes of formations and obeying the 3 players per
club rule) within budget. The results will have a lot of variation and
should not be taken as validation of either method, the results shown in
Figure 7 are more significant.

Possible Future Directions
--------------------------

In this work we partially answered the question of which one transfer
should we make each week given budget constraints. However, there is a
lot more that could be added to the models to create more accurate
predictions of the points each footballer will get each week for a given
fixture. For example

-   Use information from the player news: contains injury information,
    loan status etc.
-   Collect weather data near the home stadium
-   Other competition information, e.g.¬†played in international
    fixture/European club fixture (particularly if playing away)
